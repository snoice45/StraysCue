# Title : StaysCue - Donations

## Objective :

One-step reporting solutions, collaborations with seasoned animal 
helpers and NGOs for quick rescue, paperless case management, and 
increased trust with donors and funders through transparency are 
the objectives this project would serve. It is a web development
project where we had to build a platform that displays meta-data
and metrics about the NGOâ€™s and the ongoing cases in their facility.

## Need :
The NGOs are burdened because of the continuous flooding of cases, and
have been working inefficiently as they are unable to capture enough
details about a particular case. Since there is true lack of automation
in this process, the NGOs can greatly benefit from this tool.

## Tools and Technologies used:
The UI-UX was developed using Figma.
The frontend is made with React and backend with Django. 
Axios was used to integrate frontend with backend.

## Demo:
